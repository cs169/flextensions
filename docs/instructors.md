# Setting Up Flextensions for Instructors

This guide will get you started with using Flextensions as an instructor.
When you're ready, view the [integration guide](/flextensions/integrations).

## Importing a Course

After logging into Flextensions, navigate to the **Courses** page.

1. Click **Import courses from Canvas** to view the list of Canvas courses you’re associated with.

   > If you are not already listed as an instructor and need to import a course, click the blue link text under "If you are an instructor, import a course" to access the import interface.
   > [https://flextensions.berkeley.edu/courses/new](https://flextensions.berkeley.edu/courses/new)

2. On the **Import Courses** page, toggle the switch on the left for each course you'd like to import.

3. Click **Import Selected Courses** to finalize the process.
   > Courses you are enrolled in but do not have permissions to manage will appear at the bottom for reference only.

## Course Assignments

On the **Courses** page, click a blue course name (e.g., **CS 161**, **CS 168**) to access that course’s management dashboard.

### Syncing Assignments

If you have added new assignments in Canvas, you can click **Sync Assignments** to import the latest assignments from Canvas into Flextensions.

### Enabling Assignments

To allow students to request extensions for an assignment, toggle the **Enable** switch on the right side of that assignment’s row.

> 📝 If the course itself is not yet enabled, a warning banner will appear. You must first enable the course under **Course Settings** before students can access it.

## Course Extension Requests

Navigate to the **Requests** tab in the left sidebar to review and manage all extension requests.

### Viewing Extension Requests

Click **View** next to any request to access its full details.

#### Editing Extension Requests

1. Click **View** on the Requests page.
2. In the Extension Request Details page, click **Edit Request**.
3. Update the **Requested Due Date** or select a new date from the date picker.
4. Optionally revise the **Reason for Extension** field.
5. The system will auto-calculate the number of extension days.
6. Click **Update Request** to save changes.

## Approving or Denying Requests

You can respond to requests in two ways:

**Method 1: Requests Overview Page**
1. Go to the **Requests** tab.
2. Locate a pending request.
3. Click the green **Approve** or red **Reject** button in the Actions column.

**Method 2: Extension Request Details Page**
1. Click **View** next to a request.
2. Review assignment details and student’s explanation.
3. Click **Approve** or **Reject** at the bottom.
4. The request status will update in real time.

## Viewing Request History
To view all requests made in the course, click the **View all Requests** button at the top left.

# Course Enrollments

The **Enrollments** tab shows all instructors and students currently associated with the course, including their names, student IDs, email addresses, and roles.

## Syncing Enrollments

1. Navigate to the **Enrollments** tab.
2. Click **Sync Enrollments** to pull the latest enrollment data from Canvas.

The list will refresh with updated data, including new students and instructors, and will remove users no longer in the course.

> [!NOTE]
> ⚠️ If if a student is added to the course after you have already imported a course, you will need to sync the course enrollments to ensure they are able to access the Flextensions course.

## Filtering Student Requests
By clicking the name of a student in the **Enrollments** tab, you can filter the requests to only show those made by that student. This is useful for quickly reviewing all requests from a specific student.

# Course General Settings

The **Settings** tab lets you define how your course handles extension requests.

## Auto-approval Settings

Control when and how requests are automatically approved:

- **Auto-approve within days**
  Automatically approves requests made within the specified number of days before the assignment due date. Leave blank to disable.

<!-- - **Auto-approve within days (DSP)**
  Applies a similar rule specifically to students with a DSP accommodation flag. -->

- **Maximum requests to auto-approve**
  Sets a per-student limit on auto-approved requests. Use `0` for no limit.

After setting these options, click **Save Settings** to save.

## Course Email Settings

The **Email Settings** section (under Settings) controls how students receive notifications about their extension requests.

### Course Email Setup

Enable or disable email notifications as needed. When enabled, Flextensions sends students an email when their request is approved or denied.

You can specify a **Course Reply Email Address** for outgoing emails. This will be used as the "reply-to" address if students respond to notification emails.

💡 Ensure this address is monitored regularly by course staff.

After setting these options, click **Save Settings** to save.

### Email Template Customization

In the **Email Settings** tab, you can customize:

- Subject line
- Email body

Use provided dynamic variables to personalize each email.

**Available Variables**:

- **Student Information**
  `{{student_name}}, {{student_email}}, {{student_id}}`

- **Course Information**
  `{{course_name}}, {{course_code}}, {{assignment_name}}`

- **Extension Information**
  `{{original_due_date}}, {{new_due_date}}, {{extension_days}}, {{status}}`

Click **Reset to Default** to restore the system default template.

## Course Extension Request Form

Use the **Form** tab to customize the student request form.
> The following options are required fields and cannot be removed:
> Assignment Name, Requested Due Date, Reason for Extension.

### Writing Custom Descriptions

You can provide custom description text for:

- **Why do you need this extension?**
- **Additional Documentation**

These appear directly on the form and help guide student responses.

### Creating Custom Questions

You can add up to **two additional questions** to gather more context:

- **Title**: The main question shown to students.
- **Description**: Additional clarification or instructions.

### Setting Question Display

Each custom question as well as the **Additional Documentation** question can be configured to be:

- **Hidden**: Not shown on the form
- **Optional**: Shown but not required
